    # Summary

    # 1. Python breaks each statement into a sequence of lexical components called tokens.
    # 2.Literals are numbers, strings or characters that appear directly in a program.
    # 3.Python offers an inbuilt method called type to know the exact type of any value.
    # 4.Keywords are reserved words.
    # 5.Keywords cannot be used as identifiers or variables. An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class or other objects.
    # 6.Everything in Python is an object.
    # 7.The int function converts a string or a number into a whole number or integer.
    # 8.The float function converts a string into a floating-point number.
    # 9.The Boolean data type is represented in Python as of type bool.
    # 10.print function is used to display contents on the screen.
    # 11.input() function is used to accept input from the user.
    # 12.format() function can be used to return a formatted string.
    # 13. Python Tokens: keywords, identifiers/Variables, Operators, Delimiters, literals
    # 14. Integer Literal: 18, Floating Point Literal: 21.98, "Q" : Character literal, "Hello": String Literal
    # 15. keywords: and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, False, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, None, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return,
    # True, try, while, with, yield
    # 16. Operators: "+ - * / // % ** ---> Arithmetic Operator" "== != <> <= >= ---> Relational Operator" "and not or ---> Logical Operator" "& | ~ ^ << >> ---> Bitwise Operator"
    # 17. Delimiter: Delimiters are symbols that perform a special role in Python like grouping, punctuation and assignment. Python uses the following symbols and symbol combinations as delimiters. ( ) [ ] { } , : . ‘ = ; += -= *= /= //= %= &= |= ^= >>= <<= **=
    # 18. Identifier: • Is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits and underscore • Can be of any length • Starts with a letter which can be either lower or upper case • Can start with an underscore ‘_’ • Cannot start with a digit • Cannot be a keyword. Some examples of valid identifiers are Name, Roll_NO, A1, _Address etc.

    # Tokens and Language Structure

    # Python operates by breaking down your code into **tokens** - the smallest meaningful units of the language. Think of tokens as the "words" in Python's vocabulary. These tokens fall into five main categories: keywords, identifiers/variables, operators, delimiters, and literals. Understanding this tokenization process helps explain how Python interprets and executes your code.

    # Literals and Data Types

    # **Literals** are the actual values you write directly in your code - like the number `18`, the decimal `21.98`, or the string `"Hello"`. Python provides built-in functions to work with different data types: `int()` converts values to whole numbers, `float()` handles decimal numbers, and `bool` represents True/False values. The `type()` function is particularly useful for debugging, as it tells you exactly what kind of data you're working with.

    # Keywords and Identifiers

    # **Keywords** are Python's reserved words that have special meanings - like `if`, `for`, `def`, `class`, and `return`. These cannot be used as variable names because they're part of Python's core syntax. **Identifiers**, on the other hand, are the names you create for variables, functions, and classes. They must start with a letter or underscore, can contain letters, digits, and underscores, but cannot start with a digit or be a keyword.

    # Operators and Delimiters

    # Python includes various **operators** for different operations: arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for math, relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`) for comparisons, logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) for boolean logic, and bitwise operators for low-level operations. **Delimiters** are the punctuation marks that structure your code - parentheses for function calls, brackets for lists, braces for dictionaries, and various assignment operators like `+=` and `-=`.

    # Core Functions

    # Essential built-in functions: `print()` displays output to the screen, `input()` accepts user input as strings, and `format()` creates formatted strings. These functions form the foundation for user interaction in Python programs.

    # Everything is an Object

    # A crucial concept mentioned is that "everything in Python is an object." This means that numbers, strings, functions, and even data types themselves are objects with methods and attributes. This object-oriented nature makes Python flexible and powerful, allowing you to treat different types of data in consistent ways.
